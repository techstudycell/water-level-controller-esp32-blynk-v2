# water-level-controller-esp32-blynk-v2
n this IoT Internet of Things project, I have shown how to make the IoT-based water pump controller using ESP32 Blynk and float sensor switches.   This water level monitoring system will also check the water level in both the overhead tank and underground water tank and accordingly control the water pump automatically in AUTO mode.
